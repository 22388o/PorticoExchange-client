# Boltz v3.1.0 Documentation

This is the documentation of [Portico](https://porticoexchange.github.io/porticoexchangev2.github.io/) 

## What is Portico?

Portico is a privacy first, account-free Bitcoin exchange built on top of second layer scaling technologies like the [lightning network](http://lightning.network/). Portico doesn't track any data that could potentially be traced back to the identity of our users.

## Instances

We are running and maintaining two Boltz instances that can be used - one on [testnet](https://portico-exchange-frontend-v2.vercel.app/) and one on [mainnet] soon

The Rest API can be accessed at:

* [Testnet](https://portico-exchange-frontend-v2.vercel.app/)
* [Mainnet]soon
